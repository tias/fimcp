== FIM_CP 2.7, 2011-11-12 ==
    First official release with the new build system

    + Now automatically downloads and compiles Gecode (or point it to an existing install)
    + configures our code with the same parameters
    + Some changes to make the code work under windows
    + Compatible with gecode 3.7.1 (and lower, and probably higher too)

== FIM_CP 2.1, 2009-12-17 ==
    Release with Mac support, minor changes
    + Tested on Mac: needed -lgecodesupport in the Makefile
    + Support for gecode 3.2.2
        - should be slightly more efficient because of better propagator for linear sum of booleans
        - API change for constraint_linearPlus affected more/fimcp_standardPlus and more/fimcp_closedPlus
    + New print option: --print full, prints items and transactions
    + Some cleanups in the common/ files

== FIM_CP 2.0, 2009-07-12 ==
    Drastically changed release
    + Support for gecode 3.1.0 (including new linear propagator for boolean constraints, new support functions and parallell search)
    + New data format: annotated transaction format with labels: a combination of the FIMI format with annotations like the ARFF format.
    + Improved output options
    + Native support for class labels
    + Code cleanups, each constraint is a self-sustaining copy-pasteble block

== FIM_CP 1.1, 2008-08-07 ==
    Release for gecode 2.2.0
    + added GIST support
    + default -c-d 0 -branchval max (less memory, sometimes faster)

== FIM_CP 1.0, 2008-08-07 ==
    Initial release
