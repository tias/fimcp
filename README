This is fimcp, frequent and constraint-based itemset mining using Constraint Programming
http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/CP4IM/


Compiling, no gecode installed yet:
===================================
./configure --disable-gist
make

This will automatically download and compile gecode with the correct flags, as well as compile cimcp against this gecode codebase.


If gecode fails to compile with
"./gecode/gist/textoutput.hh:41:10: fatal error: QMainWindow: No such file or directory"
then make sure you used `./configure --disable-gist`


Compiling, with gecode installed:
===================================
add 'GECODE_LIBRARIES=...' and point it to your gecode source, e.g.:

./configure GECODE_LIBRARIES=/home/tias/local/src/gecode-3.7.1
make

if you installed the source files and the libraries in separate places, specify them separately, e.g.:
./configure GECODE_INCLUDES=/home/tias/local/src/gecode-3.7.1 GECODE_LIBRARIES=/home/tias/local/lib

For more advanced setups, see ./configure --help


The actual code is in the src/ directory,
After compiling, read src/README.
